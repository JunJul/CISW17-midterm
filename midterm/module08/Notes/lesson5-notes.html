                <!-- Two paragraph summary -->
                <p class="content-topic">Summary</p>
                <p>
                    In this lesson, I learned the box model which every element have on a web page. Every element is wrapped in three
                    layers.
                    The first layer is the margin which is the extra space of an element.
                    The second layer is a border, and the third layer is padding which is the extra space within an element.
                    I can set margin and padding by the CSS property with values such as margin-top, padding-top, margin-left, and
                    padding-left.
                    Both properties have shortcuts that define their margin and padding. For example, one value defines all sides. Two
                    values define top, bottom, and left, right.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If I want to align my content, I could use text-align and vertical-align. 
                    The difference between them is that text-align aligns content horizontally and vertical-align aligns content vertically.
                    The best practice to center content is to set the left and right margins to zero instead of using a center tag.
                    The CSS float property allows an element could be wrapped by other elements.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this lesson, I have a full understanding of the box model and learn how to change the size of a box.
                    If I set a width and height of 100px for a box, its width, and height currently are 100px.
                    When I set the margin of the box to be 10px, the width and the height should be 120px
                    because width + left margin + right margin = 100px + 10px + 10px = 120px.
                    This is the same idea when I apply padding and border.
                    After setting the layout, I should figure out the position of my elements. I have static, fixed, relative, absolute, and
                    sticky types of positions.
                    Every element is static by default. The fixed and sticky positions stay in the same position while scrolling the
                    browser.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    The most useful position types are relative and absolute position types.
                    When I set an element to be relative, it can change its position relative to its current position and does not affect
                    other elements.
                    When I set an element to be absolute, it flows out of screen control but its position is relative to its nearest
                    container.
                    I should be aware of the downside of absolute which is the element overlap issue, but I could use z-index to easily fix
                    this problem.
                    If I need to control text overflow in a box, I need to use the overflow property.

                                    A nav tag means include a navigation. 
                                    To create a vertical navigation, I can simply just create a list because vertical list is the default format.
                                    However, I can use the CSS property margin, width, and float to position my list 
                                    and add more features on them by link, hover, visited, and active.

                <p>
                    In this lesson, I learned more about how to style my list and use a nav tag to navigate on my page.
                    I can use a box model to affect my lists such as margin, border, padding, width, float, background-color, and color.
                    If I want to customize my list item indicator, I need to use the list-style-image and the list-style-type.
                    When I want to change the position of the list item indicator inside the box, I can use list-style-position.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    Furthermore, I can use the list to create an image map. I need to add an anchor tag in a li tag and specify its URL and
                    size.
                    Navigation lists differ from the regular list because I have more features than a regular list.
                    For example, when users hover over the link, the text is changed to be larger and have a different color.
                    The vertical navigation list is defaulted by HTML, but the horizontal navigation list is not.
                    I need to set the display of the ul and the li to be inline.
