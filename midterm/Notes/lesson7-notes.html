                <p class="content-topic">What You'll Learn in This Lesson</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>What is responsive web design (RWD)
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design that considers the customer’s device and adapts the design for
                                optimal viewing. RWD helps web designers and site owners by creating an “edit once, display anywhere” website.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    </li>

                    <li>Why we need RWD
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Responsive web design is a combination of many design techniques, including the following: CSS—especially media queries
                                Clean, valid HTML code, Progressive enhancement, Feature, device, and browser detection using scripts
                                , Server-side components to produce faster sites. These techquies can help us to build a better web for users.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Responsive web design attempts to respond to the device viewing the page and provide the best experience for that device
                                as possible.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Responsive design is important to mobile customers because it allows them to see the same website as nonmobile
                                customers.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                RWD allows designers to create sites that work in different devices without having to repost the content multiple times.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                RWD lets a designer build a website that doesn’t care what device the customer is using. 
                                In addition, RWD is more future-proof than standard web design. RWD doesn’t look at the device but rather looks at the
                                features.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>What is progressive enhancement
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Progressive enhancement is the process of creating a strong foundation on a website and then 
                                adding enhancements to that foundation as browsers and devices can handle them.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                When you’re concerned with building a site with progressive enhancement, your first concern is with 
                                the content—what the content is, how it will be manipulated on the site, and where the site will get it.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                A webiste has three layers: the content stored in the HTML, the presentation defined by CSS, 
                                and the behavior written in scripts like JavaScript.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>How to write HTML that’s RWD ready
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Responsive design doesn’t add any new HTML tags or attributes, which makes it easy to learn. You simply write your HTML
                                so that it is well formed, valid, and semantic, as previously mentioned. You should start with HTML5, 
                                the most recent version of HTML, which provides the most assistance to web designers who
                                want to use progressive enhancement and RWD. While you can build RWD sites using other versions of HTML, it’s best to
                                stay as up to date as possible.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Two paragraph summary -->
                <p class="content-topic">Summary</p>
                <p>
                    In this lesson, I learned theoretical knowledge about responsive web design.
                    This is a fun lesson because I can design a flexible web page that my users can visit with any device.
                    If my users want to visit my web pages with their computers, my web pages can fit their computers' screens perfectly.
                    If my users want to visit my web pages with their phones, my web pages can fit their phones' screens as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Progressive enhancement is an excellent idea to enhance my web pages.
                    I can switch my focus away from what browsers and devices my user uses, so I only need to focus on my content.
                    When I switch my mindset to progressive enchantment, I need to separate content from presentation and functionality.
                    The result is that a website has three layers, the content stored in the HTML,
                    the presentation defined by CSS, and the behavior written in scripts like JavaSceipt.

                    <li>How mobile design differs from standard web design
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The moblie desgin differs from standard web desgin because it requires to avoid using fixed-width desgins, 
                                make sure elements fitting in the desgin, keep font sizes legible, and make links tappable.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>What the Mobile First design philosophy is
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The first thing to do with Mobile First is to create the default design for all your pages for mobile devices. Think
                                about the smallest screen that might be used to view your pages.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>How Mobile First is important to RWD
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Mobile First is primarily an implementation of progressive enhancement. You focus on getting the required content and
                                functionality to as many customers as possible and then enhance the site for more diverse devices.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>How to build responsive tables and images for mobile devices
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If I want to build responsive tables, I need to resize the cells, rearrange the table, and remove or hide content.
                                The most improtnat things are to set the table width to be 100% and border to be 1
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If I want to build responsive images, I need to use the images as I always would, 
                                set the image width to something flexible, 
                                and change what images are displayed depending device properties.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Using Flexible width images: img { width: 100%; max-width: 100%; height: auto; }
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Changing the Images Displayed with srcset: &ltimg srcset="images/myImage.jpg 1x, images/myImage-2x.jpg 2x, 
                                images/myImage-3x.jpg 3x" src="images/myImage.jpg" alt="My Image"&gt. I can also replace the pixels with width like 200w.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Changing the Images Displayed with size: sizes="(max-width: 40em) 100vw, 50vw"
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I can also Change Images by Using the &ltpicture>&gt Element. Each &ltsource&gt has a media query built into it in the media attribute that tells the browser when to use those defined images.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>How to use CSS columns to create responsive designs without media queries
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                I can use the CSS column property that I can a column layout that will adjust depending upon the width of the browser.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                <!-- Two paragraph summary -->
                <p class="content-topic">Summary</p>
                <p>
                    In this lesson, I learned basic mobile web design and understand what things I should avoid and do when designing a
                    mobile web page.
                    I should avoid using fixed-width designs because users expect the pages to be flexible to adapt their any device.
                    Also, I need to make sure my elements are fitting on their devices' screens, so my elements do not render out of their
                    screens.
                    I should keep my font size at least 16px because the screen size on a mobile phone is small and the size should be
                    relative to their screen size.
                    The mobile-first idea is to focus on the content, so I need to consider placing and displaying my content on my users'
                    screens.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    I can use responsive tables and images to create a flexible web page.
                    To make tables responsive, I resize the cells, rearrange the table, and remove or hide content.
                    To make images responsive, I use the images as I always would, set the image width to something flexible,
                    and change what images are displayed depending on device properties.
                    Moreover, if I want to create a responsive design without media queries, the CSS column property is a good choice.

                <ul>
                    <li>How to write a CSS media query
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                When you are building a media query, you use the @media rule. You then define the media types the rule applies to, as
                                well as the features of that type that you want to focus on.
                                @media mediaType and (mediaFeature) { }
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                I can set the media type in any style sheet link with the media attribute. But most designers leave it off because the

                                Comma-separated list—This is equivalent to the OR logical operator.
                                @media (min-width: 760px), (orientation: landscape) { ... }

                                A CSS breakpoint is a device feature with a media query declaration assigned to it. 
                                They are most commonly based on browser widths, so most designers think of breakpoints 
                                as places where the width of the design changes to accommodate different devices.
                            </li>

                                Defining breakpoints is done with CSS media queries. The most common type of breakpoint is based on the width of the
                                device. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I can use two different media queries to define two different changes based on the width of the device.

                    In this lesson, I learned how to use media queries to define different styles for different devices.
                    A responsive web design is not limited to the width of the web, but also the style of the web.
                    Elements are displayed on different devices and they look different because different devices and browsers have
                    different settings and resolutions.
                    I can create media types in three ways, putting them into the style sheet link, importing them, and defining it in a
                    style sheet.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    When I use media queries, I can add media features.
                    Media features let me look at the specific features of the media and style your pages accordingly.
                    Moreover, I can use logical operators to define complex scenarios in media queries. The logical operators are and,
                    commas, not, and only.
                    To create breakpoints, I can define breakpoints is done with CSS media queries.
                    I have to define device features, so the style of the web page can be switched between two different styles.
