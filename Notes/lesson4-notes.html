                <p>
                    If I want to bold and italicize texts, I need to use strong and em tags instead of b and i tag.
                    The reason is that the strong and the em tags are to emphasize texts and let the browser know
                    they have special meanings. I can use special characters on a page by using numeric codes and code names.
                    Easier, I can copy a special character from somewhere and paste it into my paragraphs.
                    The pre, sup, and sub tags are to add style to a text to be a special character,
                    and I can align text by using text-align.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I want to have a list on my page, I can use list tags. We have three types of lists, ordered, unordered, and
                    definition list.
                    The ordered list is structured as a list by letters and numbers, the unordered list is structured list by bullet points,
                    and the definition list is structured as a list by header and item.
                    I can also create a simple table with a table tag. In a table, I can create rows and columns by tr and td tags.
                    If I have a lot of information that needs to display, I should use the CSS column property to divide my content in each
                    column.

                        <p class="answer">The anchor tag &lt a href="" &gt &lt /a &gt is a way to link to web page. We can add images or 
                            texts between the anchor tag, so users can click texts or images to enter another page.
                        </p>
                        <p class="answer">href is an attribute of the anchor tag and identifies the address of the page or document 
                            to which you are linking.
                        </p>

                        <p class="answer"> The anchor can also identify location within a page. 
                            I can add id in other tags and use the anchor tag to link it by href="#XXX"</p>

                        <p>How to link between pages on your own site</p>

                        <p class="answer">The first link is an absolute link. With an absolute link, there is absolutely no doubt 
                            where the link should go because the full URL is provided—domain name included. 
                            http://www.yourdomain.com/zoo.html
                        </p>
                        <p class="answer">The second link is a relative-root link. It is relative to the domain you are currently browsing.
                            /zoo.html
                        </p>
                        <p class="answer">
                            In the third link, the double dot (..) is a special command that indicates the folder that contains the current
                            folder—in other words, the parent folder. Anytime you see the double dot, just think to yourself, “Go up a level in the
                            directory structure.” ../zoo.html
                        </p>

                        <p class="answer">In the same folder, I can create two sites and use an anchor tag to link the first page to the second page.
                            Then, I can use another anchor tag in the second page to link the second page to the first page. As a result, I should use 
                            relative-root and current folder links.

                        <p class="answer">If I need to link an external content, I need to provide the anchor tag with an absolute link, 
                            which means an external content is not in the root. It is from outside, so it needs the full URL.

                <p>
                    In this lesson, I learned the anchor tag links multiple pages, so users can enter another page by clicking a link on a
                    page.
                    Inside the anchor tag, the major attribute is href. href is an attribute to identify where users will enter and what
                    happens to users.
                    If I want them to enter my another page, I will type such as href="myAnotherPage.html".
                    This is a relative-root link that stays in the same directory as the current page.
                    If I want them to an external page, I will type the full URL of that external page.

            <p>
                In this lesson, I understand that color choice is an important decision that I have to make when I create a site.
                A nice color can help me to capture my users' attention on the main content that I want to share with them.
                This turns out I should use the CSS background property to define the color of my site.
                If I want to set a border around my content, I should use border property to set my border color and border styles.
                Moreover, I learned how to images on my site by using the anchor tag and I can specify their height and width.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                When I insert images on my site, I have to make sure their file types.
                The best choice is .png because .png could allow me to change transparency and make more changes further than othertypes.
                I should keep the file size of images on my site as small as possible because loading speed is a major issue.
                The most interesting part of this lesson is the audio and video tag.
                These two tags can help me make a more attractive site and make a little inertaction between users and my site without
                JS.
