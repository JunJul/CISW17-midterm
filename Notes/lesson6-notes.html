                                    A liquid layout—also called a fluid layout—is a layout in which the body of the page does not use 
                                    a specified width in pixels, although it might be enclosed in a master wrapper element that uses a percentage width. 
                                    The idea behind a liquid layout is that it can be perfectly usable and still retain the overall design aesthetic, 
                                    even if the user has a very small or very wide screen.

                                    A fixed/liquid hybrid layout contains elements of both types of layouts. For example, you could have a fluid layout that
                                    includes fixed-width content areas either within the body area or as anchor elements (such as a left-side column or as a
                                    top navigation strip). You can even create a fixed content area that acts like a frame, in which a content area remains
                                    fixed even as users scroll through the content.

                <p>
                    In this lesson, I have learned fixed and liquid layout, and grid, flex system to organize elements on a web.
                    The fix elements are set with a default width in pixels, so when users scroll my webpage, the fix elements stay at the same position.
                    The liquid elements are set with a flexible width in percentage, so the width is relative to container of the liquid elements. 
                    When the size of the container is changed, the width in percentage unit can always fit the size of the container by the percentage value.
                    If I combine fixed and liquid layout together, it means some of the elements are flexible and some  of the elements are not.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The flex system is to create a flexible container that can contain elements and is responsive.
                    When users minimize their screens, the container can resize and rearrange items in rows or cols inside the container.
                    If I want to use a table for layout, I should consider a grid system.
                    The grid system is the best practice for table layout because it can specify the size of the row and col, and define a
                    gap between each cell.
                    The grid system can design a layout for two dimensions such as a row and col, but the flex system only design for one D
                    such as a row or col.

                    In this lesson, I learned how to format my backgrounds and add multiple backgrounds on a webpage.
                    By adding, a background on a webpage, I use the shortcut background: url('').
                    After this statement, I specify the position of the background image and size of the image and repetition
                    such as background: url('') top right / 45% repeat.
                    When I use a gradient as background, I should use linear-gradient and radial-gradient.
                    I can also define color stops after each color to decide where should the color stop at.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    To set a background color for an element, the best practice would be nth-child()
                    because I can have better control over what color of a specific element to be.
                    I can round the corner of an element by using the border-radius property
                    and I can also set an image as a border by using border-image properties.
                    Outline and border do not take any space initially;
                    however, an outline may be not a rectangular type and a border has to be a rectangle.

                <p>
                    In this lesson, I learned basic animations in CSS with two main properties. They are the transform and the transition
                    property.
                    If I want to create some simple animations, I need to use the transition and the transform property.
                    The transform property can help me to rotate, translate/position, skew/slant, and scale an element.
                    Moreover, I can transform an element into 3D. Simply, I just need to define one more dimension when I define the
                    transform type.
                    For example, rotate3d(x,y,z,angle). Also, there is a shortcut that I can define all types of transformation such as
                    transform: rotate(), translate();
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    However, the transform property is static and cannot interact with users, so I need to use transition.
                    The transition property helps the transform to move fast or slow while providing dynamic transformation with users
                    When I define transition property, I need to define transform property by using pseudo-classes.
                    Then, I set transition: property duration timing-function delay;
                </p>

                                    I can use the HTML canvas tag to create animations with the transform property.
                                    First of all, I need to define my canvas, context, and images. 
                                    Then, I declare width, height, frames, and currentFrame of the image.
                                    After that, I add a function to draw my image and add transform to my element. 
                                    Finally, I use setInterval() function to repeat my animation.

                    In this lesson, I learned more concepts about animation with transform property.
                    I can use the animation properties to create animation and have more control over the transform properties.
                    By using the animation properties, I can set the direction, iteration, play state, and fill mode of a dynamic element.
                    More importantly, it can help me specify a specific element to generate animation by using the keyframe.
                    The shortcut of the animation property is similar to the transform property, but the good thing is it doesn't require a
                    correct order.

                    As I dig the hole deeper, I discover the canvas tag is a powerful tool to add animation to an image.
                    If I want to use canvas tags to create animation,
                    I have to use JavaScript for it because I need to declare canvas
                    and context as variables in the script section to define canvas id and what type of animation it is such as 2d or 3d.
                    After that, I create a function to draw the image by a function and I return the function to a variable.
                    To repeat the animation, I put that variable into the setInterval() function to repeat the animation.

            <p>
                The CSS Flexible Box position elements that can be displayed on a line in a container. The container
                can set the dimensions of the elements inside itself to best fit the available free space. 
                A flexible box container can expand items to fill available free space or shrink them to prevent overflow in smaller spaces.

            <p class="content-topic">Define CSS grid</p>
            <p>
                The CSS grid box can psoition elements like a table but a grid box can offer more fexibilities than a table 
                because it acts like a flexible box that can adjust the spaces between each cell. Better still, the gird can set multiple rows and cols, 
                but the flexible box can only set one dimension either a row or a col.
